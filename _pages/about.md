Hi there! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University. My research interests include computer vision, image restoration, video restoration, and related fields. Previously, I worked as a research assistant in the Graphics Imaging and Media Computing Group, under the guidance of Dr. Fanhua Shang.
